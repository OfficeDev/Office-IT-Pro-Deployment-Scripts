### Check Disk Space
This script will output a CSV file with data around disk space utilization that can be assessed in a graphical view using new charts in Excel 2016. The folder also contains a spreadsheet that utilizes Power Query to import the data, and then a PivotTable to organize the data, so that you can display it in a Sunburst or Treemap chart.

**IT Pro Scenario:** This script is really designed for Excel 2016 and provides IT Pros with insight into diskspace utilization for a workstation while also exposing them to the new charts that are available in Excel 2016.
