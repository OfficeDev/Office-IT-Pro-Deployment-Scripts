                            Sets a deadline by when updates to Office must be applied. The deadline is specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You can use <strong>Deadline</strong> with <strong>Target Version</strong> to make sure that Office is updated to a particular version by a particular date.

                            We recommend that you set the deadline at least a week in the future to allow users time to install the updates. Prior to the deadline, users receive multiple reminders to install the updates. If Office isn’t updated by the deadline, users see a notification that the updates will be applied in 15 minutes. This gives users the opportunity to save the Office documents that they are working on and to close any Office programs that are open. If users don’t close the Office programs, the programs are closed automatically when the 15 minutes are up, which might result in data loss. After the Office programs are closed, the updates are applied automatically.
                        </p>
                        <br />

                            The deadline only applies to one set of updates. If you want to use a deadline to make sure that Office is always up-to-date, you must change the deadline every time that a new update for Office is available. To use this attribute, Office must be running at least Service Pack 1 (version 15.0.4569.1507) and you must use at least version 15.0.4595.1000 of the Office Deployment Tool. If you use Group Policy and the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=257051">Office 2013 Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML)</a>, you can set <strong>Deadline</strong> by using the <strong>Update Deadline</strong> policy setting. You can find this policy setting under Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Office 2013 (Machine)\Updates.
