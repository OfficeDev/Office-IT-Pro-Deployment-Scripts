### Get Office Version    
This script will query a local or remote workstation to find the detailed version of Office that is installed. With some tweaking, this script could be used as a solution to inventory the Office versions that are currently in your environment or quickly gather data when troubleshooting. 

**IT Pro Scenario:** Organizations looking to understand which versions of Office are installed throughout the company should use this script. This is used as an inventory tool to give visibility to IT Pros on the different versions of Office that are being used in the organization.
